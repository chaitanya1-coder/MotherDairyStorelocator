# MotherDairyStorelocator
This is a web based application which locates stores / branches  / offices on Google Maps of a particular enterprise. This project is based on Google Maps API and gives the exact location and information of stores present in a particular pin-code.
When user enters the pin-code, this application display address,phone number and location of all the stores located in that area. I choosed Mother Dairy as an enterprise because availability of so many stores within an area. Currently It locates 20 stores present in pin-code of 110051/110092/110031 but we can surely add more stores in future.
